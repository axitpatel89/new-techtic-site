This meeting is the most important part of the project, since it defines different nuances of the project, details complete flow diagram &amp; user journey. The meeting becomes productive, since the correct resources suitable for a certain projects are invited for the meeting and that’s where the resource allocation, timelines and bifurcation of roles and responsibilities are defined.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase II – Project Management &amp; Resource Allocation: </strong>The process involves creating tasks, and weekly sprints for project on each and every task. The tasks are allocated to the resources that have experience in working on such tasks. This also ensures allocation of correct amount of buffer time in case of any delay; hence the overall timeframe of the project can be achieved. For shorter timelines, multiple resources are allocated to different tasks and hence the sprints become more productive and reduce the overall delivery time.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase III – Mockup Design: </strong>Once the team has a complete design &amp;development brief, the next stage will be to start the design of home page and major inner pages of the website and screens for mobile application.  Photoshop Mockups will be created for your perusal based on the information in the original brief. The mockups would be further revised based on your feedback to get the final design/artwork for the website and mobile application. Your feedback would be very important to design &amp; programming team during this phase. This phase will require the client’s approval &amp; sign off.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase IV – Agile Development &#8211; Programming&amp; Quality Assurance: </strong>We work on an agile process and hence we work with weekly sprints depending upon the size of the project. Our allocated team is assigned with daily tasks to be able to achieve the target for each sprint and we take daily standup meetings to ensure that we are on track to achieve the overall goal. This ensures timely delivery and also ensures that we are keeping constant check on project. Normally, our QA team is allocated simultaneously with the development team to ensure that they constantly keep writing the test cases while the modules are being developed. This process ensures that we don’t have to test everything at once and we can always test work for each sprint and incorporate the change requests in the next sprint. This also ensures the delivery of a quality product and makes sure that our complete product is developed with constant code review, module testing, functional testing, and other tests.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase VII – Final Deployment: </strong>Upon the client&#8217;s complete satisfaction&amp; final approval, we shall upload/install the website to your hosting/server and upload the mobile application in Android and iOS. The process is seamless and code base is also delivered to the customer since we use bitbucket or gitlab for version control.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"heading":"How much does it cost to develop a Mobile App?","content":"<p>The cost of a Mobile App Developer/Mobile App Development project depends on the requirements of the projects.
